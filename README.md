# AI-F50
A cool visualization of genetic algorithms in AI by Neurual Network planes that teaches itself how to fly!

# Learning Mutation and Crossover in GA
Basically an activation function of sin(x) to determine whether the planes should jump or not. 



# The fun watching planes learn.




# Topics used for implementation
- Neat
- Pygame
- Neurual Networks
- Genetic Algorithms
